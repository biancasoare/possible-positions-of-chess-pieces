# possible-positions-of-chess-pieces
I made a chessboard! (is an 8x8 table) and a script that takes 2 numbers (x, y) smaller than 8 and      1. highlight the position plus all the boxes that represent the 'mad beat' in position (x, y)      2. highlight the position plus all the boxes representing the 'beating of a tower' in position (x, y).      3. highlight the position plus all the boxes representing the 'beating of a queen' in position (x, y).      4. highlight the position plus all the boxes representing the 'beating of a king' in position (x, y).      5. highlight the position plus all the boxes representing the 'beating of a horse' in position (x, y).
